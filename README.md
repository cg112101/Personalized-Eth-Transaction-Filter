# Personalized-Eth-Transaction-Filter

Concise:
This script helps users understand how often their wallet has transacted with certain entities like the aave lending pool. Providing a simple, but personal interface for the user to track their usage habits.

Detailed:
This code creates a web page that allows a user to view the transactions of an Ethereum wallet. The user inputs the Ethereum wallet address, an Etherscan API key, and a filter wallet address, and the code makes API calls to Etherscan to retrieve the balance of the Ethereum wallet and the list of transactions made from the Ethereum wallet. The transactions are then displayed on the page along with the balance of the Ethereum wallet. If a transaction was sent to the filter wallet address, it will be highlighted in yellow and transposed into a separate column on the page.  The code uses HTML and CSS for styling the page and JavaScript for making API calls and displaying the data. The transactions can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the balance of the Ethereum wallet. The main usage of this as demoed would be for understanding how often a users wallet has transactions with certain entities like the aave lending pool. Providing a simple, but personal interface for the user to do so.
